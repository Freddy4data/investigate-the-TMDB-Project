## Key Findings

TDMB dataset provided me with a whole lot of interesting insights about the movie industry. This insights gotten through Exploratory Data Analysis where utilized in providing answers to my numerous questions. From the research questions, some of the concluding insights were:
- The movie industry is a fast growing business over the past 50 years. There has been a massive growth since after 90s and the release of movies skyrocketed since after 2005.
- The genre with the highest revenue per year is "WAR" in the year "2009" with a revenue of over 2.8 billion USD and then closely followed by "Western" in the year "1977" with a revenue of almost 2.8 billion USD.
- The movie industry's total budget and revenue has been massively growing throughout the years especially after the 90s but there has been a problem in the rate of investment(ROI) as  the return on investment was at its highest between 1970 and 1980 and massively decreased in the late 90s. it has been growing as of late i.e after 2010, although the growth is nothing compared to that which happened in the 70s.
- There is no observable correlation between (popularity and revenue) or (popularity and budget). That is, popularity in no way affects the amount of revenue or the amount of budget.
- The movie with the highest budget is "The Warrior's Way" with a budget of around 425 million USD followed by "Pirates of the Carribean: On the Stranger Tides" with a budget of 368 million USD. This two movies are considered to be the most expensive movies.
